## 🚀 Deployment Steps for Tomorrow

### 1. Before Deployment
- [ ] Review all changes in git
- [ ] Test locally if possible (optional)
- [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message
- [ ] Push to main branch

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Verify deployment completes successfully
- [ ] Check build logs for any errors
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing

#### Critical Path Testing
- [ ] **Welcome Page** - Visit root URL, verify redirects to `/welcome`
- [ ] **Listings Page** - Click "Browse Deals", verify loads in < 10 seconds
- [ ] **Sign Out** - Test sign out button, verify redirects to welcome
- [ ] **Wholesaler UI** - Sign in as wholesaler, verify shows:
  - ✅ "My Listings" button
  - ✅ "Post a Deal" button
  - ❌ NO "Watchlist" or "Saved" buttons
  - ✅ "Alerts" button (wholesalers can have alerts)
- [ ] **Investor UI** - Sign in as investor, verify shows:
  - ✅ "Watchlist" button
  - ✅ "Saved" button
  - ✅ "Alerts" button
  - ❌ NO "My Listings" or "Post a Deal" buttons
- [ ] **Messages Page** - Click messages, verify loads conversations (not stuck)
- [ ] **Watchlist Page** - Click watchlist, verify loads (may be empty)
- [ ] **Saved Searches** - Click saved searches, verify loads (may be empty)
- [ ] **Alerts Page** - Click alerts, verify loads (may be empty)

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] Listings page loads in < 10 seconds (preferably < 5 seconds)
- [ ] No timeout errors in console
- [ ] Listings actually populate on the map and list view

#### Functional Testing
- [ ] Contact Sales form - Submit, verify no template download appears
- [ ] Test Stripe checkout with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- [ ] Verify email notifications work (if email service configured)

## 🔍 Issues to Investigate Tomorrow

### 1. Miami Listings Not Populating
**Status:** Needs investigation after deployment

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Check console for any errors when loading listings
2. Verify listings in database have Miami coordinates
3. Check map bounds - are they set correctly for Miami?
4. Test with different map areas to see if listings appear elsewhere
5. Check if spatial filtering is too restrictive

**Potential Fixes:**
- Adjust initial map center to Miami coordinates
- Verify listings have valid latitude/longitude
- Check if query filters are excluding Miami listings
- Verify map bounds calculation

### 2. Additional Performance Optimizations
If listings still load slowly:
- Consider pagination (load 100 at a time)
- Implement virtual scrolling for list view
- Add database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Consider caching frequently accessed listings

---

## 📝 Known Limitations & Next Steps

### Not Fixed (But Documented)
1. **RLS vs Source Code Security** - Documented clarification (this is expected behavior)
2. **Miami Listings** - Needs investigation (may be data issue, not code issue)

### Future Improvements Needed
1. **AI Analyzer Role Restrictions** - Still needs implementation
   - Wholesalers: Repair Estimator only
   - Investors: Comps/ARV only
   - Free tier: No access
2. **Listing Views Tracking** - Views column exists, but incrementing logic not implemented
3. **Email Testing** - Verify emails are being sent (may need SMTP verification)
4. **Stripe Test Cards** - Full test card info documented in PROJECT_STATUS.md

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Priority Order

### Priority 1 (Critical - Test First)
1. ✅ Welcome page redirect
2. ✅ Listings load time (< 10 seconds)
3. ✅ Sign out functionality
4. ✅ Wholesaler vs Investor UI differences

### Priority 2 (Important - Test After Priority 1)
5. ✅ Messages page loading
6. ✅ Watchlist/Saved/Alerts pages loading
7. ✅ Contact Sales form (no template download)

### Priority 3 (Investigation - If Time Permits)
8. 🔍 Miami listings not populating
9. 🔍 Additional performance optimizations if needed

## 🐛 Debug Checklist if Issues Occur

### If Listings Don't Load
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Network tab for failed requests
3. Verify Supabase connection
4. Check if query timeout is being hit
5. Verify listings exist in database

### If Sign Out Doesn't Work
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify auth state is being cleared
3. Check if redirect is happening (even if delayed)
4. Try clearing browser cache/cookies

### If Role Detection Doesn't Work
1. Check browser console for "Loaded user role" messages
2. Verify profile exists in database with correct role
3. Check if retry logic is working
4. Verify RLS policies allow reading profiles

### If Pages Stuck on Loading
1. Check Network tab for API calls
2. Verify API endpoints return 200 status
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify authentication is working
5. Check if API endpoints exist (404 = doesn't exist)

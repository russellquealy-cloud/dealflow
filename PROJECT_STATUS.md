## 🚧 PARTIALLY WORKING / NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

### 📝 Listings Issues

  - **Impact**: Users cannot message sellers on test listings
- 🚧 **Listings timeout**: Occasionally times out (15s limit)
  - **Status**: Improved but may need further optimization
- 🚧 **Map flickering**: Occurs occasionally during bounds updates
  - **Status**: Improved with debouncing, may need more tuning

### 💬 Messaging Issues
- 🚧 **401 Unauthorized errors**: Sometimes occurs when loading messages
  - **Status**: Fixed server-side auth, but may need cookie handling improvements
  - **Workaround**: Refresh page if it occurs
- 🚧 **Loading performance**: Messages page sometimes requires refresh to load
  - **Status**: Added guards to prevent duplicate loads, but may need optimization

### 🔍 Search & Filters
- 🚧 **Search delay**: Small delay when searching (geocoding API call)
  - **Status**: Working but could be optimized with better caching

### 📊 Analytics & Reporting
- 🚧 **Analytics buttons**: UI exists but not fully functional
  - **Location**: Admin dashboard and account page
  - **Status**: Needs data connections and real analytics
  - **Priority**: Medium (not blocking launch)

### 💳 Billing
- 🚧 **Yearly pricing**: Configured but needs testing
  - **Status**: Code complete, requires Stripe price ID verification
  - **Impact**: Low (monthly billing works)

### 🎨 UI Polish
- 🚧 **Image optimization warnings**: Next.js image component needs `sizes` prop
  - **Status**: Non-critical, performance optimization
- 🚧 **Mobile UI appearance**: User noted "sloppy" appearance
  - **Status**: Needs design review and improvements

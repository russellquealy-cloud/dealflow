# 🔒 Secure RLS Setup Guide for DealFlow

## Current Status: RLS Temporarily Disabled ✅
- App is working with RLS disabled
- This is temporary for development/testing
- **IMPORTANT:** Re-enable RLS before production!

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### What's Safe to Keep Public:
- ✅ Property listings (address, price, beds, baths, etc.)
- ✅ Property images
- ✅ Property descriptions
- ✅ Contact information (this is meant to be public for real estate)

### What Must Be Protected:
- ❌ User authentication data
- ❌ User passwords/sessions
- ❌ Internal system data
- ❌ Admin-only information

## 📋 Step-by-Step RLS Implementation

### Step 1: Test Current Setup
1. **Verify app works** with RLS disabled
2. **Test all features:** browsing, map, pins, listings
3. **Confirm data loads** properly

### Step 2: Enable RLS Gradually
1. **Start with listings table only**
2. **Test each policy individually**
3. **Don't enable all policies at once**

### Step 3: Implement Policies
1. **Copy the SQL from `rls-policies.sql`**
2. **Run in Supabase SQL Editor**
3. **Test each policy works**

### Step 4: Security Testing
1. **Test with different user accounts**
2. **Verify users can't access other users' data**
3. **Confirm public can still browse listings**

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Public Access (Safe):
- Anyone can view property listings
- No authentication required for browsing
- Contact info is meant to be public

### Protected Access:
- Only authenticated users can create listings
- Users can only edit/delete their own listings
- No cross-user data access

### Data Isolation:
- Each user's listings are isolated
- No admin bypass (even admins follow rules)
- Consistent security model

## ⚠️ Before Going Live

1. **Enable RLS policies**
2. **Test with multiple user accounts**
3. **Verify no data leakage**
4. **Test all user flows**
5. **Monitor for any access issues**

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Enable RLS on listings table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE listings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Check if RLS is enabled:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'listings';
```

### Disable RLS (emergency only):
```sql
ALTER TABLE listings DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## 📞 If Issues Arise

1. **Check Supabase logs** for RLS errors
2. **Test policies individually**
3. **Verify auth.uid() is working**
4. **Check owner_id column exists and is populated**

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ App works with RLS enabled
- ✅ Public can browse listings
- ✅ Users can only edit their own listings
- ✅ No cross-user data access
- ✅ All features work as expected

## üîç Map Bounds Filtering Debug

### Console Logs to Check
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Pan/zoom the map
4. Look for these logs:
   - `üó∫Ô∏è Map bounds emitted:` (should show bounds)
   - `üó∫Ô∏è Filtering listings for bounds size: X degrees`
   - `üó∫Ô∏è ===MAP BOUNDS FILTERING RESULTS===`
   - `üó∫Ô∏è Query returned: X listings`
   - `üó∫Ô∏è Updating state with filtered data`
   - `üó∫Ô∏è State updated successfully`

### Expected Behavior
- When zoomed out (country-level): "Map bounds too large (country-level), not filtering listings"
- When zoomed in (city-level): Listings should filter to visible area
- When panning: New listings appear, old ones disappear based on map view
- Bounds size should be between 0.01 and 10 degrees for filtering to work

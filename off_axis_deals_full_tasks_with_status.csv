- Category: AI Tools
- Priority: P1
- Task: Add line-item output to repair estimator

Objectives:
- Implement or fix this behavior so it is fully working in production.
- Do NOT change or refactor unrelated features.
- Keep the codebase Vercel-ready with zero TypeScript errors and no failing builds.

Follow this process:
1. Scan the repository for files and modules related to this task (routes, components, hooks, API routes, Supabase helpers, Stripe logic, etc.).
2. Identify the root cause or missing implementation for this task.
3. Implement the minimal but robust code changes required to complete the task.
4. Ensure correct auth, role checks (admin/investor/wholesaler), and Supabase RLS alignment where applicable.
5. Run these commands and iterate on failures until they ALL pass:
   - pnpm lint
   - pnpm test (if tests exist)
   - pnpm run build
6. If any command fails, read the error carefully, fix the cause, and re-run until everything succeeds.
7. Remove any unused variables/imports or dead code introduced during this change.

Definition of done for this task:
- The described feature/bugfix is working end-to-end in the local dev environment.
- All pages related to this task load with no runtime errors.
- pnpm run build completes successfully.
- No new TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings specific to this change remain.

Core Stability,P0,"Fix location search/geocoding errors (GEOCODE_ERROR, /api/geocode 400) so city searches like ""Tucson"" work reliably","You are Cursor, an AI pair programmer working on the Off Axis Deals production codebase (Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript + Supabase + Stripe, deployed on Vercel).

Your SINGLE focused task is:

- Fix location search and geocoding so that typing a city like ""Tucson"" into the search bar and pressing Enter:
  - Successfully geocodes the location,
  - Pans/zooms the map to that location,
  - Loads any listings in that area,
  - And if no listings exist, shows an empty-state (no markers) instead of a fatal error page.

Current behavior and errors (from production):
- When the map is over Miami and I type ""Tucson"" and press Enter, the UI shows:
  - ""Failed to Load Listings  Could not find location: Tucson  Error code: GEOCODE_ERROR""
- Browser console logs:
  - api/geocode ? 400 (Bad Request)
  - A log ""Geocoding failed Object""
- I expect ""Tucson"" to be a valid location and NOT produce an error.

What you must do:

1. Find the search bar / location search component used on the listings page (e.g. components related to the main map search and the ""Failed to Load Listings"" screen).
2. Find the /api/geocode route handler and:
   - Inspect how it builds the geocoding request,
   - Understand why a simple query like ""Tucson"" returns HTTP 400,
   - Fix the logic so that city names alone are accepted and properly geocoded.
3. Normalize /api/geocode behavior:
   - On valid geocode ? return lat/lng, place information, and any metadata needed to query listings.
   - On ZERO_RESULTS ? return a structured JSON response (e.g. { found: false, reason: ""NO_RESULTS"" }) with HTTP 200 or 404, NOT 400.
   - Only use HTTP 4xx/5xx for genuine server/request errors (invalid key, malformed request, internal error).
4. Update the frontend search flow so that:
   - Pressing Enter in the search bar always triggers a geocode for the current input text, even if autocomplete suggestions are slow or missing.
   - If geocode succeeds but there are no listings in the area, the app:
     - Centers the map on the new location,
     - Shows a No listings found in this area yet message,
     - DOES NOT show the red Failed to Load Listings error screen.
   - If geocode truly fails (e.g. bogus string):
     - Show a small inline error near the search bar (e.g. Location not found),
     - Keep the existing map center,
     - DO NOT show the fatal error screen.
5. Improve autocomplete UX:
   - Start suggestions after 23 characters.
   - Ensure network calls are debounced sensibly (not so slow that nothing appears).
   - Autocomplete should not block the Enter key flow; if suggestions lag, still geocode the raw text.
6. After changes, test all of the following flows:
   - Map centered over a random city, search ""Tucson"" ? map pans to Tucson; if no listings, show empty-state (no error).
   - Search a clearly invalid string (e.g. ""zzzzzzz"") ? inline location not found, no fatal error.
   - Search a full address or Tucson, AZ ? still works.
7. Run and fix until all pass:
   - pnpm lint
   - pnpm test (if tests exist)
   - pnpm run build

Definition of done:
- /api/geocode no longer returns HTTP 400 for valid city strings like ""Tucson"".
- The listings page never shows the full red Failed to Load Listings screen just because a location has 0 listings.
- Typing a city name and pressing Enter reliably moves the map to that city.
- The new behavior works on both desktop and mobile views.

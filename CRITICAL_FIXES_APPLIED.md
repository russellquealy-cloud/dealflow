# Critical Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ **FIXES COMPLETED**

### 1. **Account Page - Subscription Detection** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Showing "Free" plan when user is "Investor Pro"
- **Fix**: 
  - Added console logging to debug profile loading
  - Updated profile display to use `segment` and `tier` from profile table
  - Profile now correctly reads subscription from `profile.segment` and `profile.tier`
- **Note**: Check browser console to see what segment/tier values are being loaded

### 2. **Account Page - Role Selection Hanging** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Clicking "Investor" button causes infinite loading
- **Fix**:
  - Added timeout (10s) to portal page loading
  - Fixed portal page to set both `segment` and `role` correctly
  - Improved error handling in portal page

### 3. **Login Page - Hanging Issue** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Login page freezes when trying to sign in
- **Fix**:
  - Changed from `window.location.href` to `router.push()` for better Next.js navigation
  - Added `router.refresh()` to ensure session is updated
  - Reduced delay from 500ms to 300ms

### 4. **Messages Page - Input Disabled** ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Can't type in chat box
- **Fix**:
  - Added console logging to debug owner_id loading
  - Improved error handling for missing owner_id
  - Input is disabled when `!otherUserId` - check console for owner_id value

### 5. **Welcome Page as Default** ‚úÖ
- **Status**: Already configured - root page renders WelcomePage
- **Note**: If you're still being redirected to listings, it might be:
  - Browser cache (try incognito/clear cache)
  - Already logged in and something redirects logged-in users
  - Check if there's a redirect in Header or middleware

## üîç **DEBUGGING STEPS**

### Check Your Subscription Tier:
1. Go to account page
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for logs: "Profile loaded successfully:", "Segment:", "Tier:"
4. Verify the values match what you expect

### Check Messages Page:
1. Open messages page for a listing
2. Check console for:
   - "Listing loaded:"
   - "Owner ID:"
   - If Owner ID is null, that's why input is disabled

### Check Login:
1. After signing in, check if redirect happens
2. If it hangs, check console for errors

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **KNOWN ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE**

1. **Account showing wrong tier** - If still happening:
   - Your profile might not have `segment`/`tier` set correctly in database
   - Check Supabase: `profiles` table ‚Üí your user ‚Üí `segment` and `tier` columns
   - If they're null/wrong, update them manually OR the Stripe webhook should update them when subscription changes

2. **Messages input disabled** - If still happening:
   - Listing might not have `owner_id` set
   - Check Supabase: `listings` table ‚Üí check `owner_id` column exists and has values

3. **Welcome page redirect** - If still happening:
   - Check browser cache
   - Check if Header has any redirect logic for logged-in users
   - Check middleware for redirects

## üìù **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Test the fixes**:
   - Try logging in again
   - Check account page - see what console logs say
   - Try messaging - check if owner_id is loaded
   - Check welcome page on fresh browser session

2. **If account still shows wrong tier**:
   - Manually update your profile in Supabase:
     ```sql
     UPDATE profiles 
     SET segment = 'investor', tier = 'pro' 
     WHERE id = 'your-user-id';
     ```

3. **If messages still doesn't work**:
   - Check if listings have owner_id set:
     ```sql
     SELECT id, title, owner_id FROM listings LIMIT 10;
     ```

4. **Report back** with:
   - Console logs from account page
   - Console logs from messages page
   - Any errors you see

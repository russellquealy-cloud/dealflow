TASK-061,Messages & Notifications,/messages /api/messages /api/notifications /api/messages/unread-count /api/notifications/unread-count,401 Unauthorized for notifications/messages APIs and unknown sign-in loop behavior even for logged-in wholesaler accounts.,High,Partially Done – Needs Testing,,Vercel prod,2025-01-XX,"1) Login as wholesaler.free@test.com on Vercel prod.
2) Check header unread badges - should show message and notification counts without errors.
3) Open `/messages` and verify:
   - No redirect loop or sign-in loop.
   - No repeated 401s in console for `/api/notifications` or `/api/messages`.
   - Messages and notifications load properly and unread counts display correctly.
   - Conversations list renders without crashing.",All routes updated to use createServerClient() from @/supabase/server. Unread-count endpoints return { count: 0 } on error (never 401). Messages page uses redirectRef to prevent loops. Header component handles errors gracefully. RLS policies allow users to read their own messages/notifications. Needs production testing to verify cookies/headers work correctly in Vercel environment.
TASK-062,Analytics Dashboard,/analytics /api/analytics,401 Unauthorized when hitting analytics as a normal wholesaler; analytics should be available to any signed-in user (tier aware if needed).,High,Partially Done – Needs Testing,,Vercel prod,2025-01-XX,"1) Login as wholesaler.free@test.com on Vercel prod.
2) Open `/analytics`.
3) Verify:
   - API call to `/api/analytics` returns 200 (not 401).
   - Charts/metrics render without errors.
   - Data reflects that listing views are being captured (view counter is wired via ListingViewTracker component).
   - ViewsReceived metric shows correct total from all user's listings.",Analytics API route uses createServerClient() with Authorization header fallback. Removed Pro gate from analytics layout. All authenticated users can now access analytics. Listing views are tracked via ListingViewTracker and displayed in analytics (viewsReceived field). Needs production testing to verify cookies/headers work correctly in Vercel environment.
TASK-063,Analytics,/api/listings/[id]/view /listing/[id]/page.tsx,Listing view tracking - ensure views are correctly recorded and can be used for analytics charts.,High,Partially Done – Needs Testing,,Vercel prod,2025-01-XX,"1) Open a listing detail page (e.g., /listing/[id]) several times.
2) Check that the view count increments correctly:
   - Each page load should increment views by 1.
   - Views should persist after page refresh.
   - Check Supabase listings table - views column should increment.
3) Open `/analytics` and verify:
   - viewsReceived metric shows updated counts.
   - topViewedListings array includes listings with highest view counts.
   - averageViewsPerListing is calculated correctly.",View tracking implemented: POST /api/listings/[id]/view increments views column atomically. ListingViewTracker component calls this endpoint once per page load. Views are included in analytics API (viewsReceived, topViewedListings, averageViewsPerListing). RLS policies allow UPDATE on views for live listings. Needs production testing to verify tracking works correctly in Vercel environment.
TASK-064,Analytics,/analytics/heatmap /api/analytics/heatmap,Heatmap of investor interest based on listing views - higher views = stronger heat intensity.,High,Partially Done – Needs Testing,,Vercel prod,2025-01-XX,"1) Login as wholesaler or investor.
2) Open `/analytics/heatmap`.
3) Verify:
   - Heatmap displays with color gradient (blue to red).
   - Intensity is based on listing view counts (higher views = stronger heat).
   - Wholesalers see their own listings with view-based intensity.
   - Investors see all live listings with view-based intensity.
   - Map bounds auto-fit to show all listings with data.
4) Test with listings that have different view counts:
   - Open a listing multiple times to increase its view count.
   - Refresh the heatmap page and verify the heat intensity for that listing's location has increased.",Heatmap API endpoint created: GET /api/analytics/heatmap returns listings with lat/lng and views. HeatmapClient component uses Google Maps HeatmapLayer with weighted points based on views (logarithmic normalization). Gradient from blue (low views) to red (high views). Wholesalers see their listings; investors see all live listings. View tracking must be working for heatmap to show meaningful data. Needs production testing to verify visualization works correctly in Vercel environment.

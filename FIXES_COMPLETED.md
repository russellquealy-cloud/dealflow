   - Wholesaler Basic (yearly)
   - Wholesaler Pro (monthly)

## üìã **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Test the fixes**:
   - Try searching for a location - map should move
   - Check that investors don't see "My Listings" or "Post a Deal"
   - Verify loading states work correctly

2. **Configure Stripe** (see above)

3. **I'll continue fixing**:
   - Account page features display

## üêõ **KNOWNS ISSUES TO ADDRESS**

- Map still might flicker occasionally (improved but may need more tuning)
- Draw area might still disappear on some map updates
- Contact Sales might need route verification
- Analytics dashboard buttons need implementation
- Account page needs dynamic feature display based on subscription
- Messaging system needs to be created

**Most critical fixes are done. The remaining issues are either configuration (Stripe) or need additional code work.**

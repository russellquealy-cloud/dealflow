# Deployment Status

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

The build completed successfully after:
- Fixed TypeScript error in `app/supabase/client.ts` (missing logger import)
- Excluded test config files from TypeScript compilation

## Deployment Attempt

Attempting to deploy to Vercel. If not linked, you may need to:
1. Run `vercel login` to authenticate
2. Run `vercel link` to link to existing project
3. Or run `vercel` to create new project

## Files Changed (Ready to Commit)

All fixes have been made and are ready for deployment:
- TypeScript errors fixed
- Build successful
- All optimizations complete

## Next Steps

1. If Vercel CLI deployment fails, commit and push to GitHub (which should auto-deploy if connected)
2. Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status
3. Monitor for any runtime errors in production
